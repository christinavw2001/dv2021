<p>
WASHINGTON &#8212; In May of 2018, Mohamed Al-Arifi won the lottery.  He didn&#8217;t win any money, but something even more valuable: a ticket to America.
</p>
<p>
Al-Arifi, a native of war-torn Yemen, had dreamed of coming to the U.S. ever since he was a child. When he learned about the visa lottery program, Al-Arifi believed he had found a way to turn his dream into a reality.
</p>
<p>
"I registered every year," Al-Arifi said, "until the miracle happened and I was chosen in DV2019."
</p>
<p>
The diversity visa lottery is a program that allows people to immigrate to the US, with the winners randomly selected from countries with low levels of immigration to the US. Every year, up to 55,000 diversity visas are available for selectees and their unmarried children under age 21, known as derivatives. 
</p>
<p>
However, selectees and derivatives must still complete the visa application process, and if it is not completed within the fiscal year they were selected for, they lose their spot. Diversity visas usually last up to six months after they are issued. If a selectee or derivative does not get their visa before the end of the fiscal year, or if they are unable to enter the country within six months of getting their visa, they will lose their spot and must enter the lottery again. With a less than one percent chance of being selected in the visa lottery, this means they will have likely lost a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
</p>
<p>
Al-Arifi&#8217;s timing couldn&#8217;t be worse. In January 2017, President Trump had signed an executive order prohibiting travel to the US from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Yemen. The justification for the ban was national security concerns, but critics accused it of being a Muslim ban. The travel ban* was the subject of several legal battles and went through several different versions, but the Supreme Court eventually allowed it to go into effect. Although it was only an entry ban, the State Department refused to issue diversity visas to selectees from countries subject to the ban.
</p>
<p>
A State Department official said that since 1985 the State Department has denied visas to individuals whose entry into the U.S. the president has suspended. However, a federal judge has ruled that the denial of diversity visas based on an entry ban is illegal.
</p>
<p>
Al-Arifi&#8217;s family had an interview scheduled at the US embassy in Djibouti, but he had heard that because of the travel ban many who had made the trip were simply refused, so he requested that the interview be postponed in the hope that the travel ban would end. However, the fiscal year ended without Al-Arifi and his family being able to get visas.
</p>
<p>
"Here my dream was shattered for the first time," Al-Arifi said.
</p>
<p>
Al-Arifi refused to give up, applying for the visa lottery again the next year. Al-Arifi got lucky, winning again in DV-2020. However, he and his family still weren&#8217;t able to get visas.
</p>
<p>
"They destroyed us and destroyed our dreams without the slightest responsibility," Al-Arifi said.
</p>
<p>
On his first day in office, President Biden issued a presidential proclamation ending the Travel Ban, calling it "a stain on our national conscience." However, his administration later announced that diversity visa winners whose status had expired during the ban would have to re-enter into the lottery, citing federal law limiting their eligibility to one fiscal year. This means people like Al-Arifi couldn&#8217;t get visas.
</p>
<p>
Solmaz Vosog, an DV-2019 winner from Iran, said she feels her family is being discriminated against.
</p>
<p>
When they found out that they couldn&#8217;t get visas because of the travel ban, "my surprised son asked, 'Is there still religious and racial discrimination in America?'" Vosog said. "The Constitution says all human beings are equal."
</p>
<p>
Incredibly, Al-Arifi&#8217;s wife won the visa lottery in DV-2021.
</p>
<p>
"My wife and my child and I celebrated for days and nights," Al-Arifi said.
</p>
<p>
Even though the travel ban ended in January 2021, however, Al-Arifi&#8217;s family still weren&#8217;t able to get visas. 
</p>
<p>
They weren&#8217;t alone. A series of bans, policies and delays related to COVID-19 caused many DV-2020 and DV-2021 winners to lose their chance to come to the U.S.
</p>
<p>
On April 20, 2020, President Trump issued a presidential proclamation suspending the entry of most immigrants into the U.S. on the grounds that allowing in immigrants would jeopardize the country&#8217;s economic recovery from the pandemic. The state department interpreted this as a freeze on not only the entry of immigrants into the U.S. but also on the issuance of immigrant visas. Under this policy, a diversity visa winner could only be issued a visa if their entry into the country was deemed to be "in the national interest."
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, between January 2020 and April 2021, Trump and later Biden issued presidential proclamations suspending entry into the U.S. of non-Americans who were in numerous different countries during the 14 days prior to their attempt to enter the country to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In March 2020, the State Department began interpreting these regional entry bans as a prohibition of the issuance of visas to individuals subject to the bans. This means diversity visa selectees who lived in covered countries, as well as those who had to travel to one of the countries to have their visa application adjudicated, were unable to receive visas.
</p>
<p>
These regional bans lasted until October 25, 2021, when President Biden ended them via a presidential proclamation.
</p>
<p>
In addition to these bans, there were other COVID-19 policies that impacted the processing of visas. In March 2020, the Secretary of State directed all diplomatic and consular posts "to immediately suspend all routine nonimmigrant and immigrant visa services" due to the pandemic. Consular posts were restricted to providing "mission-critical and emergency visa services," which did not include processing diversity visas. 
</p>
<p>
In July 2020, the State Department issued an updated guidance creating "a phased approach to the resumption of routine visa services" known as the Diplomacy Strong framework. Under this framework, only when a consular post reaches Phase Three could it begin processing diversity visas accepted under Proclamation 10014. Even then, posts in Phase Three were to process visas according to a tiered prioritization system, with diversity visas in the bottom tier.
</p>
<p>
In November 2020, the State Department issued new guidance stating posts were no longer required to be in a specific Diplomacy Strong phase to begin processing a particular visa class. However, the Department still required posts to process visas under a tiered prioritization system that prioritized family-based and fiance visas and placed diversity visas in the bottom tier. The State Department didn&#8217;t end this tiered prioritization until November 2021.
</p>
<p>
This tiered prioritization greatly limited the number of diversity visas issued. By the end of fiscal year 2021, the State Department had issued only around 15 thousand of the almost 55 thousand visas allocated for DV-2021.
</p>
<p>
Many visa lottery winners tell similar stories. They were overjoyed when they found out they won, but their happiness turned to desperation and sadness when they found out they weren&#8217;t able to get visas, leaving them worse off than they were before. They broke off relationships, gave up educational and job opportunities and even sold their homes, all in anticipation of a promised miracle that never arrived.
</p>
<p>
A State Department official said that it is the department&#8217;s policy to try to issue as many of the 55 thousand diversity visas available each fiscal year as possible, but "there is currently no legal authority or mechanism to allow the State Department on its own initiative to provide DV applicants from prior years with an avenue to seek reconsideration of their Diversity Visa eligibility."
</p>
<p>
The official said the tiered prioritization scheme was implemented because the department had a reduced capacity for processing visa applications due to the pandemic and chose to prioritize family reunification.
</p>
<p>
However, Curtis Morrison, a lawyer representing visa lottery winners who couldn&#8217;t get visas because of COVID-19 policies in several court cases, says the real goal of COVID-19 immigration policies was to limit immigration.
</p>
<p>
"It&#8217;s a little bit of a myth that this was a COVID problem," Morrison said. "This was a Trump problem."
</p>
<p>
He said the idea that stopping immigration was necessary for the country&#8217;s economic recovery was "a myth based on (Trump advisor) Stephen Miller's point of view that immigrants come steal our jobs."
</p>
<p>
As for the regional bans based on public health concerns, Morrison pointed to how before COVID-19 Miller sought to use other diseases like Mumps to limit immigration.
</p>
<p>
Morrison also believes the tiered prioritization scheme was designed to limit immigration.
</p>
<p>
"The visa categories that are in the bottom are the ones with derivatives," Morrison said. "The ones at the top are the ones that don't have derivatives. So the whole tiered approach idea is to prevent (what immigration opponents call) &#8216;chain migration&#8217;."
</p>
<p>
Morrison criticized the Biden administration for carrying on some of Trump&#8217;s policies and for fighting in court to keep from having to issue expired diversity visas.
</p>
<p>
"They want to keep out these diversity visa immigrants," Morrison said. "Why that is, I have no idea because Biden ran on a platform that said he was going to increase the number of diversity visa allotments, but he&#8217;s fighting the ones that were allotted. It doesn&#8217;t make sense."
</p>
<p>
There is hope for some selectees due to a series of court cases where judges have ordered the State Department to reserve some diversity visas, but for the vast majority of winners, their only hope is language in the current version of the Build Back Better bill restoring diversity visas lost to Trump&#8217;s travel ban and COVID-19.
</p>
<p>
However, Morrison said he is worried the language won&#8217;t make it into the final version of the bill.
</p>
<p>
"I&#8217;m just nervous because I&#8217;m the only one lobbying for it," Morrison said. "The universities want their student visas, big tech wants their employment visas and the Democrats are doing a good job of advocating for the DACA and the path to citizenship for the people that are living in the U.S. But this is about keeping our promises to people that don&#8217;t necessarily have ties to the U.S. and so they don&#8217;t have a lot of advocacy in Congress ... I don&#8217;t want any of my clients to have false hope ... I would hate for them to stay in limbo, wondering whether or not they&#8217;re going to get relief from Congress when I know that our Congress just isn&#8217;t known for that."
</p>
<p>
However, Al-Arifi is not giving up hope.
</p>
<p>
"Our dream is simple," Al-Arifi said. "Just immigrating to America."
</p>
<p>
*Several different travel bans are referred to in this article. For the sake of clarity, the series of executive orders and presidential proclamations President Trump issued suspending entry into the U.S. for individuals from certain countries for security reasons are referred to collectively as Trump&#8217;s travel ban or the travel ban. The bans on entry for individuals who have been in certain countries in the prior 14 days to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are referred to as regional bans, and Presidential Proclamation 10014 is referred to by that name.
